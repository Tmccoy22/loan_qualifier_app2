# Loan Qualifer Application

This is a python command-line interface application that allows users to see qualifying loans from lenders quickly and easily. The application works by taking in a `daily_rate_sheet` of loan criteria from various loan providers, asking the user a number of questions to evaluate their loan eligibility, and then returning to them a list of qualifying loans. When the user find the loans that they qualify for the user can save as a csv, opt out, and have their path saved.
